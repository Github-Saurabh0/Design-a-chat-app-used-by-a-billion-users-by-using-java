# Billion-User Chat Application

A scalable chat application designed to support a billion users, built with Java.

## System Architecture

This application follows a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, reliability, and maintainability:

- **API Gateway**: Entry point for all client requests, handles authentication, rate limiting, and request routing
- **User Service**: Manages user accounts, profiles, and authentication
- **Chat Service**: Handles message processing and delivery
- **Presence Service**: Tracks online/offline status of users
- **Notification Service**: Manages push notifications
- **Media Service**: Handles file sharing and media processing

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud
- **Messaging**: Apache Kafka, WebSockets
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL (user data), Cassandra (messages), Redis (caching)
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana

## Scalability Strategies

- Horizontal scaling of stateless services
- Database sharding and partitioning
- Multi-level caching
- Asynchronous processing
- Load balancing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Maven 3.8+
- Docker and Docker Compose

### Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `mvn clean install` to build all services
3. Use Docker Compose to start the development environment: `docker-compose up`
